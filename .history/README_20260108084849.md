# AI Artist - Autonomous Art Generator

An autonomous AI artist that discovers inspiration online and creates unique artwork in its own signature style.

## Overview

This project creates an AI that:
- 🎨 Autonomously finds inspiration from image APIs (Unsplash, Pexels)
- 🖼️ Generates artwork in a consistent, unique style using Stable Diffusion
- 📅 Creates art on a schedule (daily, weekly, or custom)
- 📚 Builds a growing portfolio over time
- 🎭 Evolves its artistic style gradually
- ⭐ Curates its own work, showcasing favorites
- 🔒 Follows legal and copyright best practices
- 🛡️ Implements robust error handling and monitoring

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Autonomous Inspiration**: Pulls random images from Unsplash API
- **Style Consistency**: Uses LoRA fine-tuning for unique artistic voice
- **Automated Creation**: Schedule-based art generation
- **Portfolio Management**: Organized gallery with metadata
- **Style Evolution**: Gradual artistic development over time

### Advanced Features
- **Art Sessions**: Themed series (e.g., "Animals Week", "Urban Landscapes")
- **Self-Curation**: AI rates its own work using CLIP embeddings
- **Inspiration Log**: Tracks source images and influences
- **Multiple Styles**: Train different artistic personas
- **Social Media Integration**: Auto-post to Instagram/Twitter (optional)
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retries and fallback mechanisms
- **Observability**: Structured logging and performance metrics
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing framework
