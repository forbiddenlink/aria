# Handoff: Bug Fixes, Tests, and Skills Research for ARIA

## Task(s)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Resume from previous handoff (aria-comprehensive-improvements) | **COMPLETED** |
| Research Claude Code skills for Python/AI/generative art | **COMPLETED** |
| Run and verify test suite | **COMPLETED** |
| Fix bugs discovered by new tests | **COMPLETED** |
| Add comprehensive test coverage for new systems | **COMPLETED** |

Previous handoff: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2026-01-31_19-24-24_aria-comprehensive-improvements.md`

## Critical References

1. `src/ai_artist/personality/moods.py` - StyleAxes, mood decay, intensity (bug fix applied)
2. `src/ai_artist/personality/enhanced_memory.py` - ExperienceSystem, ReflectionSystem (bug fix applied)

## Recent changes

**Bug Fixes:**

- `src/ai_artist/personality/moods.py:100-109` - Fixed `StyleAxes.from_dict()` by adding `AXIS_NAMES` class constant. Was using `hasattr(cls, k)` which failed for instance attributes.
- `src/ai_artist/personality/enhanced_memory.py:116-134` - Fixed milestone detection order. Moved `_check_milestones()` BEFORE incrementing quality counts so `first_high_quality` and `first_masterpiece` milestones trigger correctly.

**Test Additions:**

- `tests/unit/test_moods.py:304-312` - Fixed outdated reflection sentiment tests
- `tests/unit/test_moods.py:354-500` - Added 25 new tests for StyleAxes, mood decay, intensity, serialization
- `tests/unit/test_memory_expanded.py:648-900` - Added 29 new tests for ExperienceSystem, ReflectionSystem

## Learnings

1. **`hasattr(cls, k)` doesn't work for instance attributes** - StyleAxes attributes are defined in `__init__`, not as class attributes. Use explicit set of valid names instead: `moods.py:100-103`

2. **Order matters for milestone detection** - Must check milestones BEFORE incrementing counts, otherwise `== 0` checks fail: `enhanced_memory.py:124-132`

3. **ReflectionSystem requires episodes** - `generate_reflection()` returns early without saving if no episodes exist. Tests must add episodes first: `enhanced_memory.py:324-325`

4. **XP formula is `100 * 1.5^(level-1)`** - Level 2 requires 150 XP (not 100). Level 3 = 225, Level 4 = 337.

## Post-Mortem (Required for Artifact Index)

### What Worked

- **Test-driven bug discovery**: Running existing tests revealed 2 failures from handoff changes, which led to discovering the actual bugs
- **Incremental verification**: Testing each system individually (`python -c "from ... import ..."`) before full test suite
- **Web search for skills**: Found multiple community skill marketplaces with relevant skills

### What Failed

- Tried: `hasattr(cls, k)` for from_dict validation → Failed because instance attrs not on class
- Error: Milestone tests failing → Fixed by reordering check before count increment

### Key Decisions

- Decision: Fix bugs in production code rather than adjusting tests
  - Alternatives: Could have changed tests to match buggy behavior
  - Reason: The tests correctly identified real bugs that would affect users

- Decision: Add `AXIS_NAMES` as class constant vs using `__init__` inspection
  - Alternatives: Introspect `__init__` signature
  - Reason: Simpler, more explicit, no reflection magic

## Artifacts

**Modified files:**

- `src/ai_artist/personality/moods.py:100-109` - StyleAxes.from_dict fix
- `src/ai_artist/personality/enhanced_memory.py:116-134` - Milestone order fix
- `tests/unit/test_moods.py` - 25 new tests + 2 fixes
- `tests/unit/test_memory_expanded.py` - 29 new tests

**Test results:** 145 passed in 0.71s

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Install recommended skills** (not yet done):

   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add Jeffallan/claude-skills
   /plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
   ```

2. **Commit the changes** - Bug fixes and new tests are uncommitted

3. **Style axes UI visualization** - From original handoff, still pending

4. **Test on Railway deployment** - Verify experience persists across restarts

5. **Consider vector DB migration** - Future enhancement for semantic artwork search

## Other Notes

**Recommended skills for this codebase:**

- FastAPI Expert, Python Pro, ML Pipeline from [Jeffallan/claude-skills](https://github.com/Jeffallan/claude-skills)
- Algorithmic Art, Canvas Design from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)

**Key test commands:**

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_moods.py tests/unit/test_memory_expanded.py -v
python -c "from ai_artist.personality.moods import MoodSystem; print(MoodSystem().describe_feeling())"
```

**Uncommitted changes to commit:**

- Bug fixes in moods.py and enhanced_memory.py
- New test coverage in test_moods.py and test_memory_expanded.py
