# Handoff: Commits, Skills Installation, FastAPI Code Review

## Task(s)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Resume from previous handoff (aria-tests-bugfixes-skills) | **COMPLETED** |
| Commit all uncommitted changes (bug fixes + tests) | **COMPLETED** |
| Research and install relevant Claude Code skills | **COMPLETED** |
| Run turingmind code review on uncommitted changes | **COMPLETED** |
| Run fastapi-expert review on web application | **COMPLETED** |

Previous handoff: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2026-01-31_19-50-11_aria-tests-bugfixes-skills.md`

## Critical References

1. `src/ai_artist/web/app.py` - Main FastAPI application (reviewed)
2. `src/ai_artist/web/aria_routes.py` - ARIA personality API routes (reviewed)

## Recent changes

**Commits created this session:**

- `c5fb292` - feat: add StyleAxes, ExperienceSystem, and ReflectionSystem to ARIA
- `026d578` - test: add comprehensive tests for StyleAxes, Experience, and Reflection systems

**Files committed:**

- `src/ai_artist/personality/moods.py` - StyleAxes system, mood decay, intensity, type annotations
- `src/ai_artist/personality/enhanced_memory.py` - ExperienceSystem, ReflectionSystem, type annotations
- `src/ai_artist/web/aria_routes.py` - API endpoints, type annotations
- `src/ai_artist/web/templates/aria.html` - UI for personality features
- `src/ai_artist/gallery/manager.py` - Gallery enhancements, contextlib.suppress usage
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Fixed bandit hook configuration
- `tests/unit/test_moods.py` - 25 new tests
- `tests/unit/test_memory_expanded.py` - 29 new tests

## Learnings

1. **Pre-commit bandit conflict** - The bandit hook had `-r src/` in args but pre-commit also passes individual files. Fixed by removing `-r` flag: `.pre-commit-config.yaml:51`

2. **mypy dict access returns object** - When accessing dict values like `result["list"].append()`, mypy sees the value as `object`. Fix by extracting to typed local variable first:

   ```python
   milestones_unlocked: list[dict[str, Any]] = []
   result["milestones_unlocked"] = milestones_unlocked
   milestones_unlocked.append(...)  # Works with mypy
   ```

3. **Import order in test files** - ruff E402 requires all imports at top of file. Moving imports from middle of file to top with existing imports.

4. **contextlib.suppress pattern** - Preferred over try/except/pass for ignoring specific exceptions: `manager.py:253-261`

## Post-Mortem (Required for Artifact Index)

### What Worked

- **Pre-commit hooks as quality gate**: Caught type errors, unused variables, formatting issues before commit
- **Incremental fixing**: Fixed one category of pre-commit errors at a time (ruff, then mypy, then bandit)
- **Parallel task execution**: Running skill installation and code review concurrently

### What Failed

- Tried: Committing without fixing all mypy errors → Failed because pre-commit hooks blocked
- Error: bandit hook with `-r src/` conflicting with individual file passing → Fixed by removing `-r` flag

### Key Decisions

- Decision: Fix pre-commit config (bandit) rather than skip hooks
  - Alternatives: Could have used `--no-verify`
  - Reason: Preserves code quality enforcement for future commits

- Decision: Install skills globally to `~/.claude/skills/` rather than project-local
  - Alternatives: Project-local `.claude/skills/`
  - Reason: Skills are reusable across projects

## Artifacts

**Skills installed (global):**

- `~/.claude/skills/fastapi-expert/`
- `~/.claude/skills/python-pro/`
- `~/.claude/skills/fine-tuning-expert/`
- `~/.claude/skills/ml-pipeline/`
- `~/.claude/skills/test-master/`

**Research output:**

- `.claude/cache/agents/research-agent/latest-output.md` - Skills research summary

## Action Items & Next Steps

1. **Address FastAPI review findings:**
   - Convert synchronous file I/O to async with `aiofiles` in `app.py:550-561`, `aria_routes.py:113`
   - Add response models to endpoints in `aria_routes.py:388-419`, `aria_routes.py:453-508`
   - Consider persistent state for Aria (Redis/database) instead of global `_aria_state`

2. **Push commits to remote:**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **From previous handoff (still pending):**
   - Style axes UI visualization
   - Test on Railway deployment
   - Consider vector DB migration for semantic artwork search

## Other Notes

**Available skills for this project:**
| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/fastapi-expert` | FastAPI, Pydantic V2, async patterns |
| `/python-pro` | Type hints, pytest, async patterns |
| `/fine-tuning-expert` | LoRA training patterns |
| `/test-master` | Comprehensive testing strategies |
| `/turingmind` | AI code review for uncommitted changes |

**Test commands:**

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_moods.py tests/unit/test_memory_expanded.py -v
```

**FastAPI review summary:**

- Security: Excellent (auth, rate limiting, headers)
- API Design: Good (proper REST patterns)
- Pydantic: Good (some endpoints missing response_model)
- Async: Needs improvement (blocking file I/O in async contexts)
