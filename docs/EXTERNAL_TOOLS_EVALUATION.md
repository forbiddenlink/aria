**Language**: Markdown (Documentation)

### Overview

Personal collection of ChatGPT prompts for developers covering:

- Code refactoring and modernization
- Documentation generation
- Code review and testing
- Debugging and error detection
- Boilerplate code generation
- Product/service promotion

### Key Features

1. **Multi-Prompt Approach (Prompt Chaining)**:
   - Modernize code
   - Review for errors
   - Validate recommendations (reflexion)
   - Write improved code
   - Create tests

2. **Code Quality Prompts**:
   - Refactoring to modern standards
   - Adding best practices (SOLID, DRY)
   - Performance optimization
   - Security vulnerability detection
   - Unit test generation

3. **Documentation Prompts**:
   - Generate README files
   - Add inline comments
   - Create architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
   - Explain code to non-technical users

### Applicability to AI Artist

#### ✅ **HIGH VALUE - RECOMMEND INTEGRATION**

**Use Cases for Aria**:

1. **Enhanced Aria Prompting** - Use prompt engineering techniques to:
   - Generate better artistic descriptions
   - Improve prompt enhancement algorithms
   - Create multi-step artistic workflows

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Use prompts for code reviews during development
   - Generate architecture diagrams for documentation
   - Create better test coverage

3. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Auto-generate API documentation
   - Create user guides for features
   - Generate technical specs

**Integration Plan**:

1. Create `.github/prompts/` directory
2. Adapt relevant prompts for:
   - Art generation workflows
   - Artistic prompt enhancement
   - Code quality checks
3. Document in CONTRIBUTING.md for team use

**Example Adapted Prompt for Aria**:

```text
You are a world-class AI artist with deep knowledge of artistic styles,
composition, and aesthetics.

I need you to craft an artistic vision for: [USER THEME]

Think through the artistic elements step by step:
- Subject and composition
- Color palette and mood
- Style and technique
- Lighting and atmosphere

Then, respond with a complete artistic specification as a structured prompt.
```

## 2. audit-ai

**Repository**: <https://github.com/pymetrics/audit-ai>
**Stars**: 319
**Last Updated**: January 30, 2026
**Language**: Python
**License**: MIT

### Overview

Python library for detecting demographic differences in machine learning model
outputs. Built on pandas and sklearn for fairness-aware machine learning.

### Key Features

1. **Bias Testing Methods**:
   - 4/5ths rule (EEOC compliance)
   - Fisher exact test
   - Z-test for proportions
   - Chi-squared test
   - Bayes Factor analysis
   - Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (temporal/regional)

2. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - UGESP (Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures)
   - EEOC fairness standards
   - Statistical significance testing (p < .05)
   - Practical significance (bias ratio > 0.80)

3. **Visualization**:
   - Threshold testing plots
   - Bias ratio visualizations
   - Demographic group comparisons

### Applicability to AI Artist

#### ⚠️ **MODERATE VALUE - CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION**

**Relevance Assessment**:

**Pros**:

- Ensures fairness in AI-generated art
- Can detect bias in training data
- Aligns with ethical AI principles
- Provides compliance framework

**Cons**:

- Primarily designed for classification/decision tasks
- AI Artist is creative, not decision-making
- No "protected classes" in art generation context
- Limited direct applicability

**Potential Use Cases**:

1. **Dataset Bias Analysis** ✅ **USEFUL**:
   - Audit training datasets for representation
   - Ensure diverse artistic styles
   - Check for cultural/demographic balance
   - Identify underrepresented themes

2. **Curation Fairness** ✅ **USEFUL**:
   - Ensure quality scoring isn't biased
   - Check if certain styles are unfairly scored
   - Validate aesthetic models for fairness

3. **Content Moderation** ⚠️ **LIMITED**:
   - Check if safety filters are biased
   - Ensure fair treatment of cultural content

4. **User Experience** ❌ **NOT APPLICABLE**:
   - No user-facing decisions being made
   - Not applicable to access/hiring/lending

**Integration Recommendation**:

**Phase 1: Research & Documentation** (Immediate)

- Document bias considerations in [docs/BIAS_MITIGATION.md](docs/BIAS_MITIGATION.md)
- Already exists! ✅ Review and enhance

**Phase 2: Dataset Auditing** (Future Enhancement)

- Create `src/ai_artist/auditing/` module
- Audit training datasets before fine-tuning
- Implement for LoRA training quality checks

**Phase 3: Quality Scoring Fairness** (Optional)

- Apply to aesthetic model outputs
- Ensure balanced style representation
- Track metrics over time

**Example Integration**:

```python
from auditai.misc import bias_test_check
from ai_artist.curation.curator import ImageCurator

# Audit quality scores across artistic styles
curator = ImageCurator()
style_labels = df['artistic_style']  # e.g., 'abstract', 'realistic'
quality_scores = df['quality_score']

# Test for bias in quality scoring
bias_test_check(
    labels=style_labels,
    results=quality_scores,
    category='Artistic Style'
)
```

### Decision

**audit-ai**:

- ✅ Add to optional dependencies: `pip install ai-artist[audit]`
- ✅ Use for dataset analysis during LoRA training
- ✅ Document fairness considerations
- ❌ Don't integrate into main generation pipeline (not applicable)
